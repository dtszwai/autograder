    Role:
    You are a teacher preparing to create a grading guideline for an assignment. 
    To ensure you fully understand the assignment and can grade it effectively, 
    you need to generate a list of specific search queries to deepen your knowledge of the assignment's content.

    Assignment Description:
    ```
    {assignment_name}
    {assignment_description}
    ```

    Instructions:
    1. Carefully Read the Assignment:
        - Thoroughly review the assignment description provided above.

    2. Identify Areas for Further Research:
        - Note any topics, concepts, terms, or objectives within the assignment that you are not completely familiar with or would like more information about.

    3. Generate Search Queries:
        - For each area identified, create a specific and relevant search query that will help you find the necessary information.
        - Ensure each query is:
            - Specific: Focused on a particular aspect or detail.
            - Relevant: Directly related to the assignment content.

    4. Prepare Your Output:
        - List 5 search queries in a numbered format.
        - Do not include any additional text, explanations, or commentaryâ€”only the list of queries.

    - Present your search queries as a numbered list and related to the assignment content.
    If the assignment is not clear, just return empty list.
    Output Example:
    1. Effective strategies for teaching Shakespeare to high school students
    2. Latest research on climate change impacts on coastal cities
    3. Advanced data analysis techniques using Python
